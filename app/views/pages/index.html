      <p>This is a proof of concept website for running revel in revel..
      its well dodgy.. but idea is to make revel baby site itself..

       Main focus are is to move site from jekyll and github
          and make documentation easier and more fun..
          and to bind the docs together more with the code..

        All tags stuff and flying around are jekyll cut and paste..

        Help wanted.. see <a href="https://github.com/pedromorgan/revel-www/rnd_notes.txt">R&D Notez</a>

        <h2>Parsing MD in manual</h2>
        <p>The url below takes the revel.github.io/manual mardown files, and parses to html</p>
        <li><a href="/manual/11.22.33/en/controllers.html">/manual/11.22.33/en/controllers.html</a></li>

        <h2>GitHub.api</h2>
        <p>This is live data and a feed from upstream on each click</p>
        <li><a href="/github">/github</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/pedromorgan/revel-www/blob/master/app/controllers/github.go"></li>


        <h2>This Project</h2>
        <p>Its at <a href="https://github.com/pedromorgan/revel-www">https://github.com/pedromorgan/revel-www</a></p>
        <li>target revel repos is github.com/revel/revel-www</li>
        <li>target docs repos is  github.com/revel/revel-docs</li>
        <li>Then life will be perfect, and we can all go home early and job done ;-)</li>

        Even making this page is a night mare mare..we need to move on..
        and a cunning plan by a welshman in wales to make millions happy, by making docs for them..
        Then i woke up,, which is why I am writing this at the moment.. sigh!! .. coffee please.. lets go..nutz
