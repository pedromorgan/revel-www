      <p>This is a proof of concept website for runnign revel in revel..
      its well dodgy.. but idea is to make revel baby site itself..

       Main focus are is to move site from jekyll and github
          and make documentation easier and more fun..
          and to bind the docs together more with the code..

        All tags stuff and flying around are jekyll cut and paste..

        Help wanted..

      </p>
